description: "*Pride and Prejudice* is a novel by Jane Austen that satirizes
  issues of marriage and social class. It follows the relationship between the
  quick-to-judge Elizabeth Bennet and the haughty Mr. Darcy as both learn to
  mend their errors in judgment and look beyond markers of social status. First
  published in 1813, the bitingly funny romantic comedy has endured as both a
  popular favorite and a literary classic."
